# The Game Design
It is the most crucial step of any game and for rougelites/rougelikes its the backbone. And it can take the most time in order to make a satisfying game. So no need to rush. We dont give it a number. It just said that</br>
>Making a Rougelike can be a little rough

Define the core mechanics and features of your game. Create a design document outlining the gameplay, art style, levels, characters, and progression. If you go in more depth, here is a complete list
## 1. Theme and Setting
The theme of your game provides a central concept that ties together the gameplay mechanics, narrative elements, and overall atmosphere. Here are some examples of themes you might consider:
### Fantasy Adventure:
Set in a medieval fantasy world with magic, knights, and mythical creatures. Players might explore dungeons, slay monsters, and uncover ancient artifacts.
### Sci-Fi Space Exploration:
Take players to the far reaches of space, where they explore alien planets, encounter extraterrestrial life, and navigate futuristic technology.
### Horror Survival:
Create a tense and eerie atmosphere with elements of horror. Players might be trapped in a haunted mansion or a post-apocalyptic wasteland, battling supernatural or mutated threats.
### Steampunk Mystery:
Combine the Victorian era with advanced steam-powered technology. Set your game in a city where players solve puzzles and uncover conspiracies.
### Cyberpunk Adventure:
In a dystopian future, players navigate a high-tech, low-life world filled with mega-corporations, hacking, and urban exploration.
### Mythological Quest:
Draw inspiration from various mythologies and take players on a journey through ancient gods, heroes, and mythical creatures.
The setting provides the context and environment in which your game takes place. It encompasses the physical locations, cultures, and history of your game world. Here's how you can further develop your setting:
### Geography:
Determine the geography of your game world. Is it a sprawling continent, a series of islands, or something entirely unique? Consider different biomes, landscapes, and weather conditions.
### Locations:
Create key locations within your game world. These could be cities, villages, dungeons, forests, caves, or other points of interest. Each location can have its own unique characteristics and challenges.
### Cultural Elements:
Develop the cultures, societies, and factions that exist in your game world. How do different groups interact? What are the conflicts or alliances between them?
### History:
Establish a backstory for your world. This history can influence the current state of affairs, the conflicts players encounter, and the lore they uncover.
### Technology and Magic:
Define the level of technology and the role of magic in your world. Are there advanced gadgets, arcane spells, or a combination of both?
### Characters:
Populate your world with interesting characters, both friendly and antagonistic. Each character can have their own motivations, personalities, and relationships.

## 2. Mechanics and Gameplay
In the mechanics the major things are
### Movement:
Decide whether movement will be grid-based (tile-by-tile) or free movement. Implement mechanics for navigating different terrains, obstacles, and traps.
### Combat:
Choose a combat system: turn-based (like traditional roguelikes) or real-time with pause. Design combat mechanics, including attack accuracy, damage calculations, critical hits, and blocking/defending.
### Items and Inventory:
Create a variety of items such as weapons, armor, consumables, and magical artifacts. Implement an inventory system for managing items, including equipping, using, and dropping them.
### Character Abilities:
Design unique abilities or skills that the player character can acquire or use. Consider both offensive and defensive abilities, as well as utility skills for exploration.
### Progression:
Decide how character progression will work. Will players gain experience points, levels, or some other form of advancement? Determine how character stats (such as health, strength, magic) will improve as the player progresses.
### Permadeath and Progression:
Plan how progression will work across playthroughs, considering permadeath. Can players unlock new starting abilities, items, or character options as they play more?

and for the gameplay, 

### Exploration:
Create procedurally generated maps or levels for players to explore. These maps can include a variety of room layouts, corridors, and secret passages. Include hidden areas, treasures, and interactive objects that encourage thorough exploration.
### Challenges:
Populate your levels with enemies of varying difficulty. Ensure that enemies have distinct behaviors and strategies. Introduce traps, puzzles, and environmental hazards that add challenge and variety to gameplay.
### Resource Management:
Implement systems for managing resources like health, mana, stamina, and consumable items. Make resource management a strategic element, forcing players to make decisions about when to use limited resources.
### Tactical Decision-Making:
Encourage players to make tactical decisions during combat, such as choosing the right time to attack, retreat, or use abilities. Consider implementing positioning mechanics that affect combat outcomes.
### Random Events:
Add random events or encounters that can lead to unexpected challenges or rewards during gameplay. These events can create memorable moments and keep gameplay fresh.
### Narrative Elements:
If your roguelike has a story or narrative, integrate it into the gameplay experience. This could involve dialogues, quests, or interactions with NPCs.
### Replayability:
Design gameplay mechanics and systems that encourage replayability. This might include randomization, multiple character classes, unlockable content, or branching paths.
### User Interface:
Create a user-friendly interface that displays vital information such as character stats, inventory, and the game map. Make sure the interface is intuitive and accessible to players.
