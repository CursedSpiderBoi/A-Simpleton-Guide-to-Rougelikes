    <h1>RougeLites/RougeLikes</h1>
    <p>A genre of video games that possess some, but not all, elements of roguelikes. They usually have permadeath and randomized levels. RougeLite is my favourite gerne of game. And the reason is the level of competiveness not with others but ourselves. Ultimately you play so you can go far than the last time. There is always something that you want to get it done the next time. This correct level of toughness make the game playable & memorable at the same time. Ok Now coming to the next thing, What the duck is "PermaDeath"?<br/>Permadeath or permanent death is a game mechanic in both tabletop games and video games in which player characters who lose all of their health are considered dead and cannot be used anymore. Depending on the situation, this could require the player to create a new character to continue, or completely restart the game potentially losing nearly all progress made. Other terms include persona death and player death. But all the time user gain something its mostly knowledge and sometimes a sort of game currency. But the most important thing is the knowledge. Knowledge gained in previous iterations helps user in next iteration.</p>

It literally meant "ANYTHING" like Hades, Slay the spire, Enter the gungeon, Noita, Dead Cells and many moreeee. if if you want to make such a game then buckle up you are in for a ride.
