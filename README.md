# The Game Design
It is the most crucial step of any game and for rougelites/rougelikes its the backbone. And it can take the most time in order to make a satisfying game. So no need to rush. We dont give it a number. It just said that</br>
>Making a Rougelike can be a little rough

Define the core mechanics and features of your game. Create a design document outlining the gameplay, art style, levels, characters, and progression. If you go in more depth, here is a complete list

## 1.Theme and Setting
The theme of your game provides a central concept that ties together the gameplay mechanics, narrative elements, and overall atmosphere. Here are some examples of themes you might consider:
### Fantasy Adventure:
Set in a medieval fantasy world with magic, knights, and mythical creatures. Players might explore dungeons, slay monsters, and uncover ancient artifacts.

### Sci-Fi Space Exploration:
Take players to the far reaches of space, where they explore alien planets, encounter extraterrestrial life, and navigate futuristic technology.

### Horror Survival:
Create a tense and eerie atmosphere with elements of horror. Players might be trapped in a haunted mansion or a post-apocalyptic wasteland, battling supernatural or mutated threats.

### Steampunk Mystery:
Combine the Victorian era with advanced steam-powered technology. Set your game in a city where players solve puzzles and uncover conspiracies.

### Cyberpunk Adventure:
In a dystopian future, players navigate a high-tech, low-life world filled with mega-corporations, hacking, and urban exploration.

### Mythological Quest:
Draw inspiration from various mythologies and take players on a journey through ancient gods, heroes, and mythical creatures.

The setting provides the context and environment in which your game takes place. It encompasses the physical locations, cultures, and history of your game world. Here's how you can further develop your setting:

### Geography:
Determine the geography of your game world. Is it a sprawling continent, a series of islands, or something entirely unique? Consider different biomes, landscapes, and weather conditions.

### Locations:
Create key locations within your game world. These could be cities, villages, dungeons, forests, caves, or other points of interest. Each location can have its own unique characteristics and challenges.

### Cultural Elements:
Develop the cultures, societies, and factions that exist in your game world. How do different groups interact? What are the conflicts or alliances between them?

### History:
Establish a backstory for your world. This history can influence the current state of affairs, the conflicts players encounter, and the lore they uncover.

### Technology and Magic:
Define the level of technology and the role of magic in your world. Are there advanced gadgets, arcane spells, or a combination of both?

### Characters:
Populate your world with interesting characters, both friendly and antagonistic. Each character can have their own motivations, personalities, and relationships.
